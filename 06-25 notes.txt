******PHP arrays:
>each element has its own ID for easy access
>3 types:
1. Numeric (Indexed)
	i. stores each element with a numeric ID key
	ii. implementations:

		$names=array("peter","QQ","JJ");
			--auto assign id keys

		$names[0]="peter";
		$names[1]="QQ";
		$names[2]="JJ";
			--manual assignment

		echo $names[1]." and ".$names[2];
			--access by index
2. Associative
	each ID key reference to a value
		$ages=array("pete"=>32, "QQ"=>30, "JJ"=>34);
		$ages['pete'] = "32";
		$ages['QQ'] = "32";
		$ages['JJ'] = "32";
		
		echo "pete is ".$ages['pete']." years old";

3. Multidimensional
	i. matrix - each element in an array can be an array

$fam = array 
(
  [GG] => array 
  (
	[0] => pete,
	[1] => lou,
	[2] => meg 
  ),
  [QQ] => array 
  (
	...
	...
	... 
  ),
  [Monday] => array 
  (
	[0] => clive,
	[1] => lori,
	[2] => jr 
  )
);

echo $fame['GG'][2]
shows: meg
